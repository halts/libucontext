# `libucontext`

`libucontext` is a library which provides the `ucontext.h` C API.  Unlike other implementations,
it faithfully follows the kernel process ABI when doing context swaps.

Notably, when combined with `gcompat`, it provides a fully compatible implementation of the ucontext
functions that are ABI compatible with glibc.


## supported architectures

Adding support for new architectures is easy, but you need to know assembly language to do it.

Right now these archs are supported:

 * x86_64
 * armv6+ (`arm`)
